# RSA Asymmetric Encryption 

## 🔐 Description
A complete Python implementation of RSA asymmetric encryption demonstrating key generation, message encryption/decryption, and cryptographic validation. This solution covers Question 3 (Asymmetric Encryption - 12 Marks) from a Cybersecurity Practical Application assignment.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand public-key cryptography principles
- Implement RSA key pair generation
- Practice message encryption with public keys
- Master decryption with private keys
- Validate cryptographic operations


## 🔧 Installation
Choose one of these libraries:

### Option 1: pycryptodome (Recommended)
```bash

pip install pycryptodome

🚀 Usage
Run the complete RSA implementation:

# Main implementation (pycryptodome)

python Question_3_(all in one).py
