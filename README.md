# 🔐 RSA Asymmetric Encryption Implementation

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project provides a **clear, practical, and fully functional** Python implementation of RSA asymmetric encryption. It was developed as part of a **Cybersecurity Practical Application assignment (Question 3 – Asymmetric Encryption, 12 Marks)** and demonstrates the complete lifecycle of public-key cryptography — from key generation to secure message encryption and decryption.

This repository is ideal for students, beginners, and anyone looking to understand how modern encryption systems protect sensitive data.

## 🎯 Learning Objective

By working with this project, you will:

* 🔑 Understand **public-key cryptography** principles
* 🧮 Implement **RSA key pair generation**
* 🔐 Encrypt messages using the **public key**
* 🔓 Decrypt messages using the **private key**


---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* 🐍 **Python 3.6+**
* 🔐 **pycryptodome** library for cryptographic operations

---

## ⚙️ Installation

Choose one of the supported libraries (recommended option below):

### ✅ Option 1: pycryptodome (Recommended)

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the complete RSA implementation:

```bash
# Main implementation using pycryptodome
python Question_3_(all in one).py
```

The program will:

* Generate RSA public and private keys
* Encrypt a message using the public key
* Decrypt the message using the private key
* Validate the correctness of the cryptographic process

---

## 📂 Project Purpose

This repository serves as:

* 📘 A **learning resource** for cybersecurity students
* 🧪 A **hands-on demonstration** of RSA encryption
* 📝 A **reference solution** for academic coursework

---

## 🌟 Why This Matters

Asymmetric encryption is at the heart of **secure communications**, powering technologies like **SSL/TLS, digital certificates, secure email, and key exchange protocols**. This project bridges theory and real-world application, making complex cryptographic concepts easy to understand and apply.
